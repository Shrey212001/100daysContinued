Problem:-

Watson likes to challenge Sherlockâ€™s math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value that describe a range of integers, inclusive of the endpoints. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25.

Example
a = 24
b = 49

There are three square integers in the range: 25, 36 and 49. Return 3.

Function Description

Complete the squares function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from a to b.

squares has the following parameter(s):
int a: the lower range boundary
int b: the upper range boundary
Returns

int: the number of square integers in the range

Input Format

The first line contains q, the number of test cases.
Each of the next q lines contains two space-separated integers, a and b, the starting and ending integers in the ranges.

Constraints

1 <= q <= 100
1 <= a <= b <= 109

Sample Input

2
3 9
17 24


Sample Output

2
0

Explanation

Test Case #00: In range [3, 9], 4 and 9 are the two square integers.
Test Case #01: In range [17, 24], there are no square integers.
